Your question or problem may have been answered already.

If you found a bug, please include a clear and concise description of what
the bug is and how it can be reproduced. A self-contained code example or
a link to a repository that showcases the problem would be perfect.

When you report a problem, please include the following information:

- The Operating System, e.g. Windows 10, MacOS 11.0, Ubuntu 18.04, ...
- The PHP version - you can get it by running `php -v`
- The version of the Firebase SDK (not `latest`, please determine the exact version)

The output of `composer show | grep kreait` is always a good bet.
