.. rubric:: Database secret authentication

As Database Secret based authentication has been deprecated by Firebase, it has been removed from this library.
Use Service Account based authentication instead.

.. rubric:: Firebase Factory

Previously, it was possible to create a new Firebase instance with a convenience class in the root namespace.
This class has been removed, and ``Kreait\Firebase\Factory`` is used instead:

.. code-block:: php

    # Before
    $firebase = \Firebase::fromServiceAccount('/path/to/google-service-account.json');

    # After
    use Kreait\Firebase\Factory;

    $firebase = (new Factory())
        ->withCredentials('/path/to/google-service-account.json')
        ->create();

.. rubric:: Changed namespace

All classes have been moved from the ``Firebase`` root namespace to ``Kreait\Firebase``
to avoid conflicts with official Firebase PHP libraries using this namespace.
